##What is Defensive Coding?

An approach to improve software and source code, in terms of:

- General Quality..reducing the number of bugs
- Making the source code comprehensible - the source code should be readable and understandable so it is approved in a code audit
- Making the software behave in a predictable manner despite unexpected inputs or user actions

**Clean Code**

- Improves Comprehension
- Simplifies Maintenance
- Reduces Bugs
- Easy to read
- Clear intent
- Simple
- Minimal
- Thoughtful

**Testable Code + Unit Tests**

- Improves Quality
- Confirms Maintenance
- Reduces Bugs
- Testing should not be limited to Unit Tests...integration tests

**Validation and Exception Handling**

-  Improves Predictability
-  More Consistent
-  Reduces Bugs

**Topics**

C#....duh

Clean methods lead to clean application

#### Clean, Testable, and Predictable Methods

- Clear purpose
- Good name
- Focused Code
- Short Length
- Automated Code Test
	- not easy to test code in a code behind file

**Repository Pattern**

- Pattern - predefined way to build a set of code for a specific purpose
- specific set of classes that handle data access for application
- sole purpose is to hide the details of accessing the data in one place separate from entity classes
